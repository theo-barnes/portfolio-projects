# Python Project: Machine Learning for Financial Market Prediction

## Week 1: Project Setup & Data Exploration
- **Day 1 (Thursday)**: Set up Python environment. Install necessary libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. Gather financial market datasets (e.g., from Yahoo Finance API, Quandl).
- **Day 2 (Friday)**: Explore time series data basics (stock prices, trading volumes). Visualize trends using matplotlib. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize/scale data).
- **Day 3 (Saturday)**: Perform feature engineering. Create new features such as moving averages, rolling volatility, and momentum indicators.
- **Day 4 (Sunday)**: Study time series analysis techniques (ARIMA, moving averages, exponential smoothing). Implement a simple moving average model.
- **Day 5 (Monday)**: Implement and evaluate an ARIMA model for predicting stock prices. Analyze its performance using RMSE or MAE.
- **Day 6 (Tuesday)**: Review LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and their suitability for time series forecasting. Set up a basic LSTM model.
- **Day 7 (Wednesday)**: Train the LSTM model on your dataset. Track accuracy and loss using validation data.

## Week 2: Advanced Model Development & Reinforcement Learning
- **Day 8 (Thursday)**: Fine-tune the LSTM model by adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate, number of layers). Use cross-validation to assess performance.
- **Day 9 (Friday)**: Backtest the LSTM model on historical data. Compare its predictions with actual market behavior.
- **Day 10 (Saturday)**: Begin studying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Review Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and policy-gradient methods for financial trading.
- **Day 11 (Sunday)**: Set up a basic reinforcement learning framework using `gym` and `stable-baselines3` in Python. Simulate a simple stock trading environment.
- **Day 12 (Monday)**: Implement Q-Learning to simulate a trading agent that makes buy/sell decisions based on market data.
- **Day 13 (Tuesday)**: Improve the agent by using DQN. Train it on historical stock data, and evaluate performance.
- **Day 14 (Wednesday)**: Backtest the RL model. Evaluate its profitability and risk by comparing different strategies.

## Week 3: Hyperparameter Tuning & Strategy Optimization
- **Day 15 (Thursday)**: Optimize the reinforcement learning agent’s hyperparameters (e.g., epsilon, learning rate, discount factor). Perform multiple runs to test stability.
- **Day 16 (Friday)**: Analyze the agent’s performance using Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and total return.
- **Day 17 (Saturday)**: Compare different trading strategies, including momentum-based strategies and mean reversion strategies.
- **Day 18 (Sunday)**: Integrate technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) as additional features in your trading agent’s decision-making process.
- **Day 19 (Monday)**: Backtest optimized strategies on a broader range of financial instruments (stocks, forex, commodities).
- **Day 20 (Tuesday)**: Perform a walk-forward analysis to test your models in different market conditions (bull/bear markets).
- **Day 21 (Wednesday)**: Create a detailed report of your model’s performance and strategy outcomes. Include visuals like price prediction charts, risk analysis, and model validation metrics.

## Week 4: Evaluation, Documentation, and Final Presentation
- **Day 22 (Thursday)**: Review and document all steps taken for model development, data preprocessing, and feature engineering. 
- **Day 23 (Friday)**: Finalize your Python scripts and organize them into a clean, reusable format.
- **Day 24 (Saturday)**: Refine and polish your report with detailed explanations of algorithms, strategy results, and potential improvements.
- **Day 25 (Sunday)**: Create a presentation with visual explanations of key insights. Highlight the models that performed best and why.
- **Day 26 (Monday)**: Review the project code and ensure it is optimized and well-commented for future use.
- **Day 27 (Tuesday)**: Prepare the final deliverable, including the codebase, reports, and presentation.
- **Day 28 (Wednesday)**: Upload the project to GitHub or your personal website. Present the results to a mentor or peer for feedback.

---

### Final Deliverables:
- **Python Codebase**: Organized and well-commented code for financial market prediction using ML and RL models.
- **Report**: A comprehensive document outlining your approach, results, and model evaluations.
- **Presentation**: A visual summary of the project, key insights, and outcomes.
